# autumnblaze

(eventually will be) the code behind Autumn Blaze#1324

## use
1. create a node project with `npm init`, or create your own package.json
2. `npm install PCelestia/autumnblaze`
3. create `index.js`
4. stick this inside it (eventually when it actually does something)
```js
require("autumnblaze")({
   token: "your_bot_token"
});
```
## other stuffs
- hopefully more config options available soonish
- current bot is closed source, working to rewrite it and publish it
- that does nothing right now so dont bother lol
