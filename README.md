# autumnblaze
another general purpose discord bot. i wrote my own because i don't feel really satisfied with existing bots, and so i know the ins and outs of it and can customise it to my needs. also its sort of a fun project!

**to add the bot, go to my page [here](https://pcelestia.github.io/botsitelol/).**

you can view my plans and things for the bot at [my trello board thing](https://trello.com/b/6o7eZylC/autumnblaze-bot). there will be more details on how to use the bot (as they become available) on the site. also, i am in the process of making a support server for this bot.

## privacy and data collection
the only information this bot stores is what you explicitly tell it to store using the `config` command. along with the data you pass to the command, it also stores the guild ("server") id. upon removing the bot from a server, the data is retained, so that nothing is lost if the bot is ever added again. the data can and will be deleted on request. to request data removal, dm me on discord (Autumn Blaze#2864).
