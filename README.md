# autumnblaze
another general purpose discord bot. i wrote my own because i don't feel really satisfied with existing bots, and so i know the ins and outs of it and can customise it to my needs. also its sort of a fun project!

to add the bot, go to my page [here](https://pcelestia.github.io/botsitelol/)

you can view my plans and things for the bot at [my trello board thing](https://trello.com/b/6o7eZylC/autumnblaze-bot).

there will be more details on how to use the bot (as they become available) on the site.
